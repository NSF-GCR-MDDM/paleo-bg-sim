/*
General to-do:
  - Check compatibility with geant4
  - Update CMakeLists - I added some flags for GDML but I don't think those are needed any more
  - We should comment in the macro some commands which should NOT be included (beamOn, initialize)
  - I removed the commands allowing this to run in interactive mode, we should decide if we want to re-add 
  - Get external geometry viewer working
  - MiniBooNE -> PaleoSim naming
  - General testing, general clean up if we have includes that are no longer needed

    //       is probably air but maybe we want flexibility, 3. a shielding volume, and 4. a target
    //       or crystal cell.

    // TODO: Right now I'm filling primaries tree branches in the generators. This could potentially be
    //       moved into the beginning of event action (the way it's handled in the main branch) which
    //       is a lot cleaner. However, if we do so we should create a GeneratorUserInformation class or
    //       something like that which brings in additional information about the generated primaries (e.g.
    //       theta, phi, slant depth) which get filled if the generator type is set properly. We also should
    //       loop over all primaries in the BeginningOfEvent action when loading properties in case multiple
    //       were added to the vertex
